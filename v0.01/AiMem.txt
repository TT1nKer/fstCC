==================

1. Created fstccV001.s - Basic assembly structure for bootstrap compiler
   - Added compiler metadata and version info
   - Set up memory sections (.data, .bss, .text, .rodata)
   - Created buffer allocations for source code, tokens, symbol table
   - Implemented main compiler pipeline functions (stubs)
   - Added test input data

2. Created README.md - Project documentation
   - Added project description and goals
   - Documented minimal C subset for bootstrap
   - Listed current status and TODO items
   - Added build instructions and compiler pipeline overview

3. Set up Git repository and SSH keys
   - Generated SSH key pair for GitHub authentication
   - Initialized git repository
   - Configured git user identity
   - Made initial commit with all project files
   - Set up remote origin for GitHub repository

CURRENT STATUS:
- Assembly structure complete
- Git repository initialized
- SSH keys generated
- Ready for lexer implementation

4. Organized build system
   - Created build/ subfolder for all build scripts
   - Modified build.bat, build.sh, build_wsl.sh to work from build/ directory
   - Added README.md for build instructions
   - All build outputs now go to build/ directory
